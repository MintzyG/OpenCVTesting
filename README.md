## How to use
  - Clone this repo and edit lines 41 and 65 to mention an input image path and a output path
  - Build and run the program
  - Specify the amount of colors you want in the result image

## Disclaimer

  Right now the program gets the amount of colors you asked for and gets that amount of colors randomly from the input image, these chosen colors will make up the output image so you may have to run the program multiple times to get the output you desire.

## Plan to add
 - Hability to "Open with" any image file with the program and it auto fills the path
 - Automatically save the output image to the image folder of the current user
