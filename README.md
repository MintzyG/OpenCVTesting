## How to use
  - Download the .exe
  - Drag and Drop any image file on the .exe
  - The resulting image will be saved to the folder where it originally came from as a png

## Disclaimer

  Right now the program gets the amount of colors you asked for and gets that amount of colors randomly from the input image, these chosen colors will make up the output image so you may have to run the program multiple times to get the output you desire.
