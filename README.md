# OpenCV Tone Remover

This program gets an image and a number of desired colors from the user and removes tones from the image until it only has the desired amount

Right now ot works by picking random colors from the image to be the final colors, so you might have to run the program multiples times to get the desired output

| Input image |  Output image |
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![]()  |  ![]()
